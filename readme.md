# Resume Parsing using Natural language processing
Project Inspired by **Prof.Chaky** and my dear friend **Tonson**,**Ati** and also well support from our TA **Amanda**

Resume parsing is the process of automatically extracting information from a resume and converting it into a structured format using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. This includes extracting the text from the resume file, identifying and extracting individual fields of information, classifying the information into specific categories, and transforming it into a structured format. The goal is to make the process of reviewing and storing resumes more efficient and accurate.

### Limitation
1. Formatting: Resumes come in different formats and styles, which can make it difficult for the parser to extract information consistently.
2. Missing information: Resumes may not contain all the information required for a particular job application, which can lead to missing or incomplete data.
- *There is a lot of potential for continued improvement in the field of resume parsing, and it will likely continue to play a critical role in automating the recruitment process for many organizations.*

## Setup Environment using flask in localhost

1. Install Flask: You can install Flask by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: pip install Flask
2. Create a new Flask project: You can create a new Flask project by creating a new directory and creating a file named app.py in that directory.
3. Install required packages: If you plan to use any additional packages for parsing resumes, you can install them using the pip install command.
4. Run the Flask application: You can run the Flask application by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt: FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run. or
   - cd project directory
   - python app.py
   - Note: Test the application: You can test the application by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your web browser or add any port you want 3000..
